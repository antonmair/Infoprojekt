---WHAT IS IT---

An algorithm that creates a path in between two vectors, trying to make it as smooth as possible


---USAGE INSTRUCTIONS---

Run _main.py, input 4 points, the first point defines the start of vector 1 the second point defines the end of vector 1, the third point defines the start of vector 2 and the fourth the end of vector 2

IMPORTANT: The line will be drawn from end of vector 1 (point2), towards start of vector 2 (point3), point 1 and 4 determine the direction that the curve will try to smooth towards.

---CONCEPT---

An algorithm that with four given points defining two vectors, finds the optimal right of way (calculating distance of 180° on all given points).
